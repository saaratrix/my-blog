        After developing JavaScript for 2 years+ I decided to test typescript in november 2015 and oh boy was I in for a treat!
        If you want to read about typescript the main website is found at <a href="//www.typescriptlang.org/">www.typescriptlang.org</a>.
        The typescript documentation can be found <a href="//www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html">here.</a>
    </p>

        Now why do I like typescript?
        In short I like it because of its improved intellisense (autocomplete) capabilities over javascript.
        I also prefer statically typed languages like C# over dynamically typed languages.

        When I started using typescript I noticed it reduced the amount of errors such as mistyped property names on objects or after refactoring code.
        The types helped to catch incorrect usage of an api or other type errors before running the code and test it.

        Another advantage with typescript was when using Visual Studio 2013 was that the tools got improved because Visual Studio would understand the code better.
        For example the Rename Variable (F2) was greatly enhanced and could now rename properties across multiple files at once.
        Another tool that was improved was the <strong>Find all references</strong> which allows you to see where an object is being used.
        <br>
        <br>
        The bad thing about typescript is that it adds another layer of building your javascript output since it first has to be compiled to javascript.
        <br>
        <br>
        I really like typescript and I enjoy it more than writing javascript so I'm recommending you to try it if you haven't yet if you like statically typed languages.
